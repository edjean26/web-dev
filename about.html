            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I am Edjean L. Amparado, a hardworking individual with a deep fear of and faith in God. For the past five years, I have been a working student, balancing work, studies, and my commitment to serve God.
                My motivation comes from my desire to support my family and meet my own needs and aspirations. Since my family cannot fully support my education, I have taken the initiative to work while studying to achieve my dream of completing college.
                My goal is to finish my education, secure a stable job, and create a better future for myself and my family. I believe that with faith, determination, and hard work, I can achieve anything, as without God, we can do nothing and Faith without works is dead.
                -James 2:20
